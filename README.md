# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Heart disease prediction using machine learning involves analyzing and processing heart disease patient datasets with different algorithms such as KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression. The goal is to accurately predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using input features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical parameters. With the help of machine learning, it is possible to improve the research and prevention process of heart diseases, ensuring more people can live healthy lives. These predictive models can be used to diagnose heart disease at an early stage, allowing for prompt treatment and management of the condition. Overall, heart disease prediction using machine learning can be a valuable tool in the fight against cardiovascular disease.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)


Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
