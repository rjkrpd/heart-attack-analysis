# heart-attack-analysis
Heart attack analysis using machine learning involves developing predictive models that can accurately identify patients at risk of heart attack based on their medical history and risk factors. The goal of this analysis is to improve early detection and diagnosis of heart disease, as well as improve patient outcomes.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

##Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)
Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
